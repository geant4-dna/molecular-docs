# Documentation for Molecular DNA

The documentation here is built using Jekyll, which allows a static site to be built
using markdown.

Pushing this repository to the master branch will (one day) trigger a build of the
website and documentation.

The site can be viewed locally by calling:
```
bundle install  # if you haven't already
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This packages requires Ruby to be installed.

Instructions on how to update the docs are at https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/
