# molecularDNA
{: .fs-9 }

Radiation-induced DNA damage simulations in Geant4.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

molecularDNA is a Geant4-DNA example built to allow easy simulation of
radiation-induced DNA damage with *flexible geometries* and well defined
*damage parameters*.

Get started right away in *geant4/examples/extended/medical/dna/moleculardna* with a *library of pre-existing geometries*,
or dive into the documentation.
