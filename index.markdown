**Radiation-induced DNA damage simulations in Geant4**
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

molecularDNA is a Geant4-DNA example built to allow easy simulation of
radiation-induced DNA damage with *flexible geometries* and well defined
*damage parameters*.

Get started right away in the Geant4 *geant4/examples/advanced/dna/moleculardna* directory with a *library of pre-existing geometries*,
or dive into the documentation.

A **tutorial** demonstrating molecularDNA is also available at this [link]({{ "http://geant4-dna.in2p3.fr/tutorials/HandsOn-molecularDNA.pdf" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}.

 <span style="color:red">**Important** : This example is for demonstration purposes and is intended as an introductory tool for users to create their applications. Therefore, users are advised to adapt and optimize the simulation parameters in their applications accordingly.</span>
