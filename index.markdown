# Molecular DNA
{: .fs-9 }

Radiation-induced DNA damage simulations in Geant4.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Molecular DNA is a Geant4-DNA program built to allow easy simulation of
radiation-induced DNA damage with *flexible geometries* and well defined
*damage parameters*.

Get started right away using our *docker container* and a *library of pre-existing geometries*,
or dive into the documentation.
