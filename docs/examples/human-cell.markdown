## Overview
DNA damage induced by irradiation in a simplified human fibroblast cell can be simulated using the provided **human_cell.mac** macro file. A large amount of memory and computer performance will be required for this example. The parameters used in the macro file and shown in this page are further described in Phys. Med. 112 (2023) 102613 ([link]({{ "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2023.102613" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}) and in Phys. Med. 127 (2024) 104389 ([link]({{ "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2024.104839" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}).

## Geometry
The default geometry (macro **human_cell.mac**) consists of a continuous chain defined by taking a basic Hilbert curve. This fractal is broken into cubic regions of straight and turned chromatin sections [DNA placement]({{"/docs/geometry-library/dna-placements" | relative_url}}). This chain is included in an ellipsoid with semi-dimensions 7.1 μm x 2.5  μm x 7.1 μm, which imitates a cell nucleus. Only cubes that are completely included in the ellipsoid are considered as parts of the chain, which length is 6.4 Gbp. Bp density of the produced cell corresponds to ~0.015 bp/nm3.

The DNA geometrical model and the irradiation setup in the simulation are as follows:

Left: The 3D geometry of the cell nucleus (14.2 μm x 14.2 μm x 5 μm) used in the human_cell.mac macro file, showing the continuous fractal interior. Right: The beam geometry used in the simulation, showing the incident protons as a parallel beam.

The chromosome as region of interest for damage analysis is defined using:

```
/chromosome/add cell ellipse 7100 2500 7100 0 0 0 nm 0 0 0
```
## Particle source
A proton source plane with circle radius 7.1 um is located 3 μm from the cell center.

## Damage model
Direct damage model sets 5 eV for the lower break threshold and 37.5 eV for the upper break threshold. A probability of 40.5% is set for the production of strand break.
```

## Results
Output (see [analysis]({{"docs/overview/results-and-analysis"| relative_url}})) is analysed by using the **human_cell.C** ROOT macro file.

- **Species Hits (/Gy/Mbp)** is defined by radical + DNA reactions,
for example: EaqStrandHits is e_aq + DNA backbone


- **Damage yield (/Gy/Gbp)** is defined by DNA damage complexity (see [classification model]({{"/docs/overview/results-and-analysis" | relative_url}}))


- **Breaks yield (/Gy/Gbp)** is showed for each break type (direct SSB, indirect SSB, DSB,...).

*Fragments distribution of DNA. A fragment is defined by a distance between two DSBs.*

## List of Geant4 macros
The example provides three macros to simulate the cellular irradiation of four different cell types, see Phys.

Med. 127 (2024) 104389 ([link]({{ "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2024.104839" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}) :

## List of ROOT macros
Three ROOT macros are provided to analyze the simulation results obtained with the above Geant4 macros : **human_cell.C**, **human_cell_alphas.C** and **human_cell_chromosomes.C**.
