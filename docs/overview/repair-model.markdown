# Repair Model

This model calculates the accumulated proteins yield, by considering four principal DSB repair pathways. These pathways are a) non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), b) homologous recombination (HR), c) single-strand annealing (SSA), and d) alternative end-joining mechanism (Alt-NHEJ). The number of non-repairable DSB/Gy/cell is needed (N_{cDSB}), as well as the number of DSBs that is more probable to be repaired (N_ncDSB). More analytically, by [belov]:

Where N_0 is the total numbe of DSB (N_ncDSB+N_cDSB). V_NHEJ,V_HR,V_SSA  and V_microSSA are mathematical variables that characterize the way that each model affects the way that DSBs are repaired. D is the dose (Gy). a(L) is the slope coefficient of linear dose dependence that describes DSB induction per unit of dose (Gyâˆ’1/cell) and depends on LET.
