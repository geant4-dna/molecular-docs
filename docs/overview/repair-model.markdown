# Repair Model

This model calculates the accumulated proteins yield, by considering four principal DSB repair pathways. 

These pathways are [1]: 
- non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ),
- homologous recombination (HR), 
- single-strand annealing (SSA), and 
- alternative end-joining mechanism (Alt-NHEJ). 

The number of non-repairable DSB/Gy/cell is needed ($N_cDSB$), as well as the number of DSBs that is more probable to be repaired (N_ncDSB). More analytically:

Where: 
- N_0 is the total numbe of DSB (N_ncDSB + N_cDSB). 
- VNHEJ, VHR, VSSA and VmicroSSA are mathematical variables that characterize the way that each model affects 
the way that DSBs are repaired. 
- D is the dose (Gy). 
- a(L) is the slope coefficient of linear dose dependence that describes DSB induction per unit of dose (Gyâˆ’1/cell) and depends on LET.
