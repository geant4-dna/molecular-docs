# Molecular DNA Overview
{: .no_toc }

The Molecular DNA program is designed to allow anyone to simulate early
DNA damage using only Geant4 macro commands - No C++ skills needed.

The program takes inputs through the form of macro commands which define
the geometry, damage model, physics, chemistry and run conditions for the
simulation.

If you are entirely new to this, the best place to start is looking at the [Anatomy of a Macro File]({{site.url}}/docs/overview/macro-anatomy).
