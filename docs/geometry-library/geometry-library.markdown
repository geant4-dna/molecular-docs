# Geometry Library
{: .no-toc}

Here you'll find geometries that can be used with the Molecular DNA package.
If you want to make new geometries, you can start with the FractalDNA tools
which are accessible on Github, or read about our [Geometry Model]({{ "docs/overview/geometry-model" | relative_url }}).
