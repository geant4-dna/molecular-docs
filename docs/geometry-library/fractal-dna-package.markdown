Geometries for use in Molecular DNA can be generated yourself, or with the
help of the [FractalDNA](https://github.com/natl/fractaldna) Package in Python.

The FractalDNA package (documentation [here](https://natl.github.io/fractaldna/))
provides Python methods for building DNA segments that can be joined together
by the Molecular DNA program, as well as assembling geometries.

FractalDNA can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install fractaldna
```
