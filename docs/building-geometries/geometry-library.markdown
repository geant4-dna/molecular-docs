# Building geometries
{: .no-toc}

Here you'll find geometries that can be used with the molecularDNA example.
If you want to make new geometries, you can start with the [FractalDNA](https://natl.github.io/fractaldna/){:target="_blank"} tools
which are accessible on [github](https://github.com/natl/fractaldna){:target="_blank"}, or read about our [geometry model]({{ "docs/overview/geometry-model" | relative_url }}).
