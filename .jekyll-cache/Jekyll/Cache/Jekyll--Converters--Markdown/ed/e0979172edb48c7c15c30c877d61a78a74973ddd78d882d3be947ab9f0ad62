<p>The Molecular DNA program is designed to allow anyone to simulate early
DNA damage using only Geant4 macro commands - No C++ skills needed.</p>

<p>The program takes inputs through the form of macro commands which define
the geometry, damage model, physics, chemistry and run conditions for the
simulation.</p>

<p>If you are entirely new to this, the best place to start is looking at the <a href="http://localhost:4000/docs/overview/macro-anatomy">Anatomy of a Macro File</a>.</p>
