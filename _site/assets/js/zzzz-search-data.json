In Molecular DNA, we associate damage either with a ‘strand’ molecule (sugar or phosphate placement) or a base molecule. The maximum distance from the centre of a molecule which can result in any energy deposition tied to that model is called the direct interaction range and can be set using dnageom/interactionDirectRange. To assign damage, the program looks up all molecules with the direct interation range of a given energy deposition and assigns the damage to the closest molecule. In the literature direct strand break damage models typically take the sum of the energy depositions in the sugar-phosphate part of the DNA strand and calculate the chance of a break based on the energy deposition. We simulate this using the /dnadamage/directDamageLower and /dnadamage/directDamageUpper commands. Essentially: . | Energy Deposition below directDamageLower never causes a break | Energy Deposition above directDamageUpper always causes a break | Between these bounds, the likelihood of a break rises uniformly | . The likelihood of a break, for a lower bound of 5eV and an upper bound of 37.5eV is shown below . Some models assume a step likelihood function for physical damage. This can be modelled by setting /dnadamage/directDamageLower and /dnadamage/directDamageUpper to the same value. ",

      "content": "Indirect Damage is scored when a chemical reaction leads to a strand break. The chemical reactions between radicals and DNA elements themselves are defined in the Chemistry Model through the MolecularChemistryList class. The phosphate part of the sugar-phosphate backbone rarely takes part in reactions (reactions between radicals and phosphate are not even defined in the simulation), so the main factors in the indirect damage model are the likelihoods that a reaction between a radical and the DNA backbone lead to a single strand break (SSB). Each probablity is defined through the macro interface as below . | Reaction | Macro Command | . | \\(Pr(\\ce{e^{-}_{aq}} + \\mathrm{Sugar} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SSB})\\) | /dnadamage/indirectEaqStrandChance | . | \\(Pr(H^{\\bullet} + \\mathrm{Sugar} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SSB})\\) | /dnadamage/indirectHStrandChance | . | \\(Pr(\\ce{^{\\bullet}OH} + \\mathrm{Sugar} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SSB})\\) | /dnadamage/indirectOHStrandChance | . Base Damage is modelled through a similar interface, though two steps are provided for the modelling of both base damage generally, and also strand break induction (while this might seem redundant, it was coded for a level of flexibility). For a given base, we can consider seperately the likelihood that the chemical reaction between the base and the radical causes damage to the base pair, and the likelihood it causes a strand break. In the case of \\(\\ce{^{\\bullet}OH}\\) /dnadamage/indirectOHBaseChance 0.5 would set the likelihood that the simulation should consider a reaction between \\(\\ce{^{\\bullet}OH}\\) and a base as damage as 50%. If base damage does occur, /dnadamage/inductionOHChance 0.4 would mean that following base damage, the chance of that damage causing an SSB is 40%. Note that these are dependent events, so the likelihood of the reaction causing an SSB is 20%. For most work, you would probably consider all chemical reactions with a base as base damage, but assume these don’t lead to SSBs.

This parameter is complimentary with what other simulations would model as scavenging or an early simulation cut-off time, in that it is linked to the distance a radical is expected to diffuse before the simulation ends. In particular, for a radical with a diffusion constant \\(D_c\\), we expect it to diffuse a distance \\(\\bar{x}\\) in time \\(t\\) as follows: . \\[\\bar{x} = \\sqrt{6D_ct}\\] For the \\(\\ce{^{\\bullet}OH}\\) radical (\\(D_c=2.8\\times 10^{-9}m^2s^{-1}\\)), this gives \\(\\bar{x} = 4.09 \\sqrt{t} \\ \\mathrm{nm}\\).

A simple example of this is below, containing 14 base pairs (grey), alongside the sugar (red) and phosphate (yellow) molecules in the chain. These files are specified as either 11 or 14 column ASCII text files with the schema below: . | MOLECULE_NAME - Name of the molecule | SHAPE Optional - Shape of the molecule (Sphere or Ellipse) | CHAIN_ID - Index for the chain | STRAND_ID - Index for the strand (either left or right side of the DNA molecule) | BP_INDEX - Index of the base pair in the volume (per chain) | SIZE_X Optional - semi-major x axis of ellipse (Å) | SIZE_Y Optional - semi-major y axis of ellipse (Å) | SIZE_Z Optional - semi-major z axis of ellipse (Å) | POS_X - x position in volume (Å) | POS_Y - y position in volume (Å) | POS_Z - z position in volume (Å) | ROT_X - rotation around the X-axis | ROT_Y - rotation around the Y-axis | ROT_Z - Rotation around the Z-axis | . Distances are specified in Angstrom, while angles are specified in radians (and correspond to the three Euler angles). Specifying Molecule Sizes . The molecule size columns are optional, as they can either fall back onto the default sizes or be set to custom sizes in the macro definition via: . /dnageom/useCustomMoleculeSizes /dnageom/moleculeSize name x y z units . Note that molecule name matches are case insensitive. The default molecule names and sizes are: . | Molecule Name | X semi-major axis (Å) | Y semi-major axis (Å) | Z semi-major axis (Å) | . | phosphate | 2.282354 | 2.282354 | 2.282354 | . | sugar | 2.632140 | 2.632140 | 2.632140 | . | guanine | 3.631503 | 3.799953 | 1.887288 | . | cytosine | 3.597341 | 3.066331 | 1.779361 | . | adenine | 3.430711 | 3.743504 | 1.931958 | . | thymine | 4.205943 | 3.040448 | 2.003359 | . | histone | 25 | 25 | 25 | . Adding multiple chains . A simple way to increase the density of DNA in simulations is to place multiple chains of DNA in each placement volume. Multiple ‘chains’ can be placed in the one placement volume as shown below, provide that they each have a different chain_id in the data file. Here, we show graphically what a 1-chain and 4-chain placement volume could look like. The simulation platform supports 1, 4 and 8 chains. It will join chains together correctly even when placement volumes are rotated along the lines of the image shown below. Defining DNA Placements . Placement files should be defined with either of the following two (space seperated) schemas: . Specifying Size for every molecule . NAME SHAPE CHAIN_ID STRAND_ID BP_INDEX SIZE_X SIZE_Y SIZE_Z POS_X POS_Y POS_Z ROT_X ROT_Y ROT_Z . Not specifying size for every molecule . NAME CHAIN_ID STRAND_ID BP_INDEX POS_X POS_Y POS_Z ROT_X ROT_Y ROT_Z . Spatial units are angstroms, angles are in radians. Molecule names cannot contain spaces. The program assumes that the file is ordered first by base pair, then strand, then chain as below, keeping the order Phosphate, Sugar then Base. Histones when specified can be placed anywhere in the file however (they are often at the start or end). NAME ... CHAIN_ID STRAND_ID BP_INDEX Phosphate 0 0 0 Sugar 0 0 0 Base 0 0 0 Phosphate 0 1 0 Sugar 0 1 0 Base 0 1 0 Phosphate 0 0 1 Sugar 0 0 1 Base 0 0 1 Phosphate 0 1 1 Sugar 0 1 1 Base 0 1 1 Phosphate 0 0 2 Sugar 0 0 2 Base 0 0 2 Phosphate 0 1 2 Sugar 0 1 2 Base 0 1 2 Phosphate 1 0 1 Sugar 1 0 1 Base 1 0 1 . The order Phosphate - Sugar - Base must always be kept. Each chain is specified completely before a new chain starts, and base pair sections are specified in their entirety before a new base pair section is specified. This is done to enable the file to be read in such that their is a fixed distance between any molecule and its neighbours. This facilitates the cutting of certain shapes within Geant4 so that each shape can be represented with the maximum volume possible. The program will assume the neighbouring molecules for a given sugar, phosphate or base are: . | Base Pair, strand ID 0: Sugar at :-1, base at :+3, base at :-6 | Base Pair, strand ID 1: Sugar at :-1, base at :-3, base at :-6 | Sugar: Phosphate at L-1 | Phosphate: Sugar at L+5 | . Once defined, a placement volume can be loaded using the following command: . /dnageom/placementVolume name path twist . For example: . /dnageom/placementVolume turntwist geometries/turned_twisted_solenoid_750.txt true . Considerations for Base Pairs . When building the geometry, you’ll probably consider a base pair in an unrotated space and then rotate the base pair to produce the chain you desire, as well as the standard double helix. Our geometries have been built and tested with the primary axis of the double helix in a straight DNA segment being the Z-axis. Similarly, a base pair on its own is built so that its height (the 3.4Å-long axis) is the Z-axis. We rely on this assumption to know that, in a frame of reference prior to any rotation, a base pair should be roughly 3.4Å in height. This assumption is used to help stop molecule placements intersecting each other. If you are developing geometries alongside the Python package FractalDNA, these changes should be done automatically.

Most of this is done through the damage model, but there are some implementation details in the geometry model. Physics Cross Sections . Inside each molecule in DNA’s volume, we use the cross sections for that material rather than the cross section of water. Sometimes we shrink/cut these molecules in order to place them, which has an impact on the volume of the simulation which uses their cross-section, as below, where the red sugar and yellow phosphate molecules are cut so as not to overlap. This has a very minimal impact on the actual physics of the simulation as the regions occupied by DNA are so small compared to the water region. Parallel Worlds for Physics and Chemistry . In the implementation, the physics geometry is implemented in a parallel world, while the chemistry executes in the primary Geant4 world which contains only water. This means the chemistry itself never needs to react with a DNA Geant4 geometry, as the DNA geometry is in the parallel world. Instead the chemistry interacts with the DNA geometry via a seperate memory structure associated with the mother placement volume. ",

The first things we define are the sizes of our placement volumes. Here we use 50 nm side length cubes, but these can be rectangular prisms of any shape. /dnageom/placementSize 50 50 50 nm . In this example there are three placement definitions for a straight section, a turned section, and a turned with a 90˚ twist section. /dnageom/placementVolume turn geometries/1strand_50nm_turn.txt /dnageom/placementVolume turntwist geometries/1strand_50nm_turn.txt true /dnageom/placementVolume straight geometries/1strand_50nm_straight.txt .

Currently, cylindrical, spherical and elliptical chromosome shapes can be defined, which are mapped onto the placement volumes defined by the large scale geometry. The below image shows, for example how two chromosomes can be defined to yield two regions of interest, overlaid on the grid which defines the overall geometry. Where chromosome regions overlap, energy depositions will be recorded in both. Importantly, the DNA geometry is only placed inside chromosomes. Using this, a square geometry can be coerced to a circular form, by placing a spherical chromosome as we do here: . /chromosome/add cell sphere 200 0 0 0 nm . ",

      "title": "Set up the Damage Model",
      "content": "A number of parameters are used to determine how DNA damage works in the simulation. The first of these determine how the geometry in particular influences the simulation. /dnageom/radicalKillDistance 4 nm /dnageom/interactionDirectRange 6 angstrom . The Radical Kill Distance tells the simulation to kill all chemistry tracks further than 4nm from the DNA. This parameter is an implicit bound on scavenging. It basically assumes all chemical radicals that need to diffuse 4nm to react with the DNA will be scavenged before they are able to interact chemically with the DNA molecule. The Direct Interaction Range describes to what radius direct (physics-driven) energy depositions should be ascribed to a DNA molecule. Here, only energy depositions with 6Å can contribute a direct strand break. The next part of the damage model handles how direct strand breaks are calculated. The below snippet defines a step function where a cumulative deposition of 17.5eV or more in one event will cause a break. /dnadamage/directDamageLower 17.5 eV /dnadamage/directDamageUpper 17.5 eV . The lower and upper values here describe a broken linear function where: . | Energy Deposition below directDamageLower never causes a break | Energy Deposition above directDamageUpper always causes a break | Between these bounds, the likelihood of a break rises uniformly | . An example of this, for a lower bound of 5eV and an upper bound of 37.5eV is shown below . Next, we define the likelihood of chemical damage occurring for different reactions as below: . /dnadamage/indirectOHBaseChance 1.0 /dnadamage/indirectOHStrandChance 0.4 /dnadamage/inductionOHChance 0.00 . Indirect damage here is what is typically discussed in most papers, it is the likelihood of a chemical reaction occurring between either OH (in this case) and either a base or strand molecule. A lot of research only considers reactions between radicals and strands as leading to strand breaks, and this simulation considers that all reactions between a strand and a radical cause a break. On the other hand, it’s rarely considered that an interaction between a radical and a base can lead to a strand break. If, for whatever reason, you want to model this, you can use the induction chance. This is the probability that base damage leads to a strand break. For most simulations, all that is important are the Radical+Strand break chances, which are set by: . /dnadamage/indirectOHStrandChance 0.4 /dnadamage/indirectHStrandChance 0.4 /dnadamage/indirectEaqStrandChance 0.4 . for the •OH, H+ and eaq radicals respectively.
